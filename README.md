# CWC-15
The following project implements an Analytical Server "OHLC". Functionatilty available in OHLC Engine:
  1. Search the different stocks based on the symbols and view the chart.
  2. Displays moving average of stock price over given number of days.
  3. Switch between OHLC, Candlestick charts, Vertex Line and Hollow Candle.
  
  ### **Technologies/Frameworks Used :**  
    1. Python Libraries
        a. Matplotlib 
        b. Pandas
        c. Matplotlib finance API 
    2. Python Tknter Graphical User Interface for dashboard
    
  ## **Problems Faced :**
    1. Problem definiton looks very straightforward, however there are multiple small complex modules from data loading to visualization.
    2. To begin with it was choosing technology considering Python, JavaScript,Python and different API's.
    
  ## **Outcomes :** 
    1. Understanding the problem statement, deciding the line of action and then working on the project and producing the desired output in stipulated amount of time was itself a challenge.
    2. As students we have been predominantly working on C,Java and basics of Python throughout first two years of college. Picking up a project comprising of huge data sets and plotting graphs(candlestick,bar graph and hollow candle) and displaying it on a dashboard where we learned the TkInter GUI in the process. 
    3. Working in a team along with fellow classmates beyond the classroom also has been a great experience.
    
  ## **What's next for the project :** 
    We aim to improvise the code and take all the parameters into consideration while plotting the chart. At a later stage of the application we will be able to predict the prices of particular stock.
